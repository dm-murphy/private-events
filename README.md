# Private Events

## Quick Take

An application from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) Rails curriculum that focuses on the use of ActiveRecord's associations. This project aims to build an event app similar to Eventbrite where users can create and manage events, send private invitations, and attend events hosted by other users. It teaches more about ActiveRecord associations by requiring many-to-many relationships, foreign keys and custom class names.
